Assignment 10: Student Info System (Final Mini Project)

Create a directory called `student_app/` and a Python file inside it named `main.py`.

Tasks:
1. Store name, age, and grade of 3 students using variables.
2. Use a loop to display each studentâ€™s information in this format: "Name: [name], Age: [age], Grade: [grade]"
3. Use an if-else condition to display:
   - "Status: Passed" if the grade is 50 or higher
   - "Status: Failed" otherwise
5. Use a match-case (or if-elif) statement to categorize and print each student's level based on their grade:
   - grade >= 80: "Excellent"
   - grade >= 60: "Good"
   - grade >= 50: "Average"
   - below 50: "Fail"

Output Format (Example for one student):

   Name: Alice, Age: 20, Grade: 85  
   Status: Passed  
   Level: Excellent  

Turn in:
- Directory: student_app
- File: main.py
